# Base 
1. All code using Kotlin + Koin to Dependancy injection<br/>
2. project split into two module, one for base(baseFrament + baseActivity...), one for logic code.<br/>
3. Library: Glide, RxAndroid...<br/>
4. Structure of app using: Android Architecture Components(Livedata, viewmodel...)<br/>
5. Unit test apply for validation.<br/>
final: because I don't have design, so I'm just focus on functionality, UI seem very poor.:)), <br/>
U can read each commit in this repository to easy understand each part. <br/>
